  <p>This animal is said to be the most loyal among all domesticated animals in the world.  Many have noted that this beast is "man's best friend".   Police and other law enforcement used this animal to help track the scent of those suspected of crimes.</p>

  <p>If this animal is owned by irresponsible masters, it is sure to become aggressive and injur humans.  It is very important to have properly trained pets, especially German Shephard dogs.</p>
